		<h2>Information</h2>
		There are eight kangaroos in Animal Crossing New Horizons. Well, technically there are fourteen, including the the babies of the girls. If the older
		kangaroo villagers are included, then there are eleven different kangaroos. This page is just a page that has some basic information on them, as well
		as a gallery of pictures of them. This, although it may not be complete, nor look the best, it has the inforation and hopefully works correctly. Over
		time though, this website might actually get more conplex and be more visually appealing. The staff of this company wishes you the best experince on 
		this test website. Enjoy learning and viewing on this website test!

		<body>
			Some of the kangaroos did not get to be in the newer Animal Crossing games, so here is just a list of those ones.
				<ul>Koharu the peppy</ul>
				<ul>Marcy the other peppy</ul>
				<ul>Valise the snooty</ul>
			All three of these were only in the older Animal Crossing games, but it is not completly for sure why.
